;                is 1-based (1-N))
;             Integer - numeric value corresponding to the default symbol

;                which deteremines whether or not the following symbol
;                list should be used to describe the parameter identified
;                in the preceeding 0-record. (array index is 1-based)
;             Float - value which the preceeding database parameter must
;                equal in order for the following symbol list to be used
;                to describe the parameter identified in the preceeding
;                0-record.
;             Integer - numeric value corresponding to the default symbol

;
;      2      Integer - the numeric value corresponding to this symbol
;             String - the symbol string which is used to select the
;                value of the database parameter identified in the 
;                preceeding 0-record.
;
;      3      String - BEMEnums Include File name (can include full path

;  Note regarding 0-records:
;   - Multiple records beginning with 0 ocurring one after the other 
;     cause the following symbol lists to be defined for each of the
;     database parameters described in each 0 record.
;
;  Notes regarding 1-records:
;   - Records beginning w/ 1 occur only when the list of selectable
;     symbols or the default symbol varies based on the value of another
